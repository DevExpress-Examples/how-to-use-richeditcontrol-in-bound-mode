# How to use a RichEditControl in bound mode


<p>This example illustrates how to bind the RichEditControl to an Rtf data column and handle Rtf content saving/loading operations (note that actual data is stored in the SQL Server database). The major aspects covered by this example are:</p><p>1) Choosing the SQL column data type for Rtf content. Most often, the <strong>varchar(max)</strong> type is sufficient for this purpose (note that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format"><u>Rich Text Format</u></a> is an 8-bit format). We have discussed this topic in the context of the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q311679">save RTF-document to database - which column-type is the best</a> thread. See also: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386947.aspx"><u>SQL-CLR Type Mapping</u></a>.</p><p>2) Supporting two data persistence levels in the client application: control (RichEditControl) level and memory (DateSet) level. The first level is controlled by the Undo Manager of the RichEditControl (see the <a href="http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rachelreese/archive/2011/07/14/winforms-xtrarichedit-undo-redo-an-illusion-of-simplicity.aspx"><u>WinForms XtraRichEdit – A History of Undo and Redo</u></a> blog post to learn more on this subject). We utilize the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraRichEditRichEditControl_Modifiedtopic"><u>RichEditControl.Modified Property</u></a> to define the current state of this level. The changes at this level are accepted/rejected by the end-user via the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraEditorsDataNavigatortopic"><u>DataNavigator</u></a>. Memory level is maintained by the ADO.NET DataTable container. You can find more information on this subject in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ww3k31w0.aspx"><u>Row States and Row Versions</u></a> webpage. The changes at this level are accepted/rejected by the end-user via separate buttons above the RichEditControl.</p><p>The actual RichEditControl binding to the <strong>RtfContent</strong> column is established via the bindable <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraRichEditRichEditControl_RtfTexttopic"><u>RichEditControl.RtfText Property</u></a> in the Form1_Load event handler.</p><p>To test this example locally, you should setup "CarsDB" sample database in your SQL Server instance. Create a database with this name and utilize Script.sql file, attached with this example, to generate a sample table schema and data.</p><p>The picture below illustrates the sample in action.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-use-a-richeditcontrol-in-bound-mode-e3480/9.3.5+/media/2f5e7b7c-fc11-4179-8b04-70209f8a4694.png"></p>
